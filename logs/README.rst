Logging Directory
------------------

This directory holds all of the log files generated by the application.

Logs are saved in JSON format.  Express.js packages the requests and responses objects in a JSON format and writes them one per line.  So each line is a different request or response.  Looking at the status code lets you know what was and wasn't successful.
